Project Proposal: Video Game

Project Overview:
The "Video Game" project focuses on creating an engaging hack-and-slash adventure where the player is an explorer
trying to find treasure among ancient ruins. The game will feature multiple levels, enemies, obstacles, and power-ups,
providing a dynamic and challenging experience.

Game Objectives:
1. Implement core mechanics: walking, jumping, attacking.
2. Design 3 levels and a boss stage with 6 unique layout variations.
3. Create enemy placeholders and later expand to 10 animal-type enemies.
4. Add 10 obstacle types with damage or blocking effects.
5. Integrate power-ups for health, attack, and speed boosts.
6. Include door mechanics for vertical progression and treasure collection.

Scope of Work:

Phase 1: Player Movement & Core Controls (Week 1)
- Implement walking, jumping, and attack mechanics.
- Add collision detection for platforms and obstacles.
- Use placeholder assets for player and terrain.

Phase 2: Enemy & Obstacle Basics (Week 1)
- Create enemy placeholders with simple movement patterns.
- Implement basic attack behavior for enemies.
- Add 10 obstacle types with damage or blocking effects.

Phase 3: Level Loader & Progression (Week 2)
- Build system to load 3 levels and a boss stage.
- Add door mechanics for vertical progression.
- Implement treasure collection logic.

Phase 4: Power-Ups & UI (Week 2)
- Develop power-up system (health, attack, speed).
- Add UI elements: health bar, power-up indicators.
- Integrate feedback for pickups and damage.

Phase 5: Enemy Variety & Boss Logic (Week 3)
- Expand enemy behaviors for 10 animal types.
- Add attack variations and movement patterns.
- Implement boss fight mechanics.

Phase 6: Level Design & Art Pass (Week 3)
- Design 6 variations of level layouts for replayability.
- Replace placeholders with simple art assets (ruins tileset, animal sprites).
- Add environmental details and polish platforming feel.

Deliverables:
1. A playable prototype with core mechanics.
2. Fully implemented levels and boss stage.
3. Enemy and obstacle systems.
4. Power-up system and UI elements.
5. Art assets replacing placeholders.
6. Documentation for setup and gameplay.

Tools & Technologies:
- **Game Engine:** Pygame (for 2D game development)
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Art Tools:** Aseprite or GIMP for sprite creation
- **Level Design:** Tiled Map Editor
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

Timeline:
- Phase 1: Week 1
- Phase 2: Week 1
- Phase 3: Week 2
- Phase 4: Week 2
- Phase 5: Week 3
- Phase 6: Week 3

**Total Estimated Time: 3 weeks**

Risks and Mitigation:
- **Scope Creep:** Stick to defined features; avoid adding unnecessary complexity.
- **Performance Issues:** Optimize collision detection and rendering.
- **Art Delays:** Use placeholders initially and replace gradually.

Conclusion:
This project will deliver a fun and challenging hack-and-slash game with treasure hunting, enemy encounters,
and platforming mechanics. By following the phased approach, we ensure steady progress and a polished final product.
